If you have high blood pressure, it's a good idea to check with your doctor or pharmacist to find out what's right for you. You can also try decongestant-free cold medicines, such as Coricidin HBP.",

Also, the FDA warns that several zinc nasal sprays have been linked to a permanent loss of smell. For all these reasons, the side effects from zinc may outweigh any possible benefits.",

The droplets are then inhaled by another person. Colds can also be spread when a sick person touches you or a surface (like a doorknob) that you then touch.",

The increased incidence of colds during the cold season may be attributed to the fact that more people are indoors and close to each other. In addition, in cold, dry weather, the nasal passages become drier and more vulnerable to infection.",
